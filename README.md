gt course watcher written in node.js with mongodb back end.

allows users to make course watch requests and be notified at the email they provide upon open slot.

to run a local instance, do:

node app.js

to run the start forever script do:
chmod +x ./start
./start

running list of things this project has helped me learn:

using websockets

javascript:
	closures
	making objects with prototype
	(among other js related things)

making custom modules in node

mongodb

twitter bootstrap

express framework

handlebars templating

asynchronous nature of javascript (and coping with it)

scraping websites

using SMTP

and most importantly, general project organization for clean, modular, maintainable code
